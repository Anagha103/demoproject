    <p>The iPhone is a series of smartphones made by Apple Inc since 2007. It is a mobile phone, meaning that it makes calls and sends text messages without wires. There are many types of iPhones. The iPhone can access the Internet as well, either using a cellular network or over Wi-Fi. Like an iPod, it can play music and videos that have been downloaded from the Internet directly, or which have been put on it by connecting it to a personal computer.</p>
